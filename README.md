# Roman Numerals Kata 

Using Test Driven Development to solve Roman Numerals Kata

# Defining the problem

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters: 

- **I** meaning **1**,
- **V** meaning **5**, 
- **X** meaning **10**,
- **L** meaning **50**,
- **C** meaning **100**.

We would like to be able to convert numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents.

### Test Driven Development

![TTD lifecycle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10700103/23134527/09fabe52-f78d-11e6-90d8-b747714a52f6.png)

**Test-driven development (TDD)** is basically a methodology or a software development process that is based on the **repetition** of the following tasks:

- write a simple test that defines an expected functionality/outcome
- make the test fail (it will fail as we haven’t written any code just yet!)
- write your code as simple as possible to make your test pass
- refactor your code and run the same test again (it should pass as even though is refactored the functionality should be the same).

> The key concept is to write your **unit test before** you write a line of implementation **code**.

### Ping pong programming

1. Person A writes a new test and sees that it fails.
2. Person B implements the code needed to pass the test.
3. Person B writes the next test and sees that it fails.
4. Person A implements the code needed to pass the test.

And so on. Refactoring is done whenever the need arises by whoever is driving.

# Let’s get started!

### 1. Clone

Clone the repository by copy-pasting the following command into your terminal:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/skibinska/romanizer.git && cd romanizer
  ```

### 2. Go to test/tests.js

and let’s code :)
