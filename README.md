# Roman Numerals Kata 

Using Test Driven Development to solve Roman Numerals Kata

# Defining the problem

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters: 

- 'I' meaning '1',
- 'V' meaning '5', 
- 'X' meaning '10',
- 'L' meaning '50',
- 'C' meaning '100', 
- 'D' meaning '500',
- 'M' meaning '1000'.

We would like to be able to convert Arabic numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents.

### Ping pong programming

1. Person A writes a new test and sees that it fails.
2. Person B implements the code needed to pass the test.
3. Person B writes the next test and sees that it fails.
4. Person A implements the code needed to pass the test.

And so on. Refactoring is done whenever the need arises by whoever is driving.
