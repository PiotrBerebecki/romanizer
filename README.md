# Roman Numerals Kata 

Using Test Droven Development to solve Roman Numerals Kata

# Defining the problem

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; 

- 'I' meaning '1',
- 'V' meaning '5', 
- 'X' meaning '10',
- 'L' meaning '50',
- 'C' meaning '100', 
- 'D' meaning '500',
- and 'M' meaning '1000'.

We would like to be able to convert Arabic numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents.
